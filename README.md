## Who We Are

MixMatch is all about creating a space where singers, songwriters, musicians, and producers alike can meet and engage with likeminded talent. Our platform is designed to make it as easy as possible to discover people with similar personalities, lifestyles, and sounds. Whether you're an amateur musician looking to build relationships with other creatives, or a freelancer looking to find other artists for jam sessions, or even a talent scout looking to diversify their network for industry events, MixMatch is the place to do it.
